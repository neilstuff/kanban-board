# Kanban Board 

**Application **

This is a very simple Kanban Board Application

**This is a simple Kanban Board**

A application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML with jQuery. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.pug` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**. This utilises the 'pug' interpreter.

You can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start).
